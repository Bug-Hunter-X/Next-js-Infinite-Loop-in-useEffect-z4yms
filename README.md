This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications: an infinite loop caused by improperly using the useEffect hook.  The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version. The issue arises from updating the state variable `count` within the useEffect dependency, creating an infinite loop. The solution removes the dependency, preventing the infinite loop.
